# KidneyWorks

A job platform dedicated to **raising awareness** among employers and **connecting** them with kidney dialysis patients, **providing a platform** for patients to **find employment opportunities** that are flexible and accommodating to their medical needs.

## We're live!

You can find our live site hosted on Firebase at [KidneyWorks](https://kidney-works.web.app/)!

## Problem statement

> How can we get employers to empathise, understand, and hire kidney patients who have limited education levels and mobility due to their health conditions and treatment schedule?

## Mission
Our mission is to bridge the gap between employers looking for qualified and motivated employees and patients seeking meaningful employment opportunities.

## Vision

We believe that every individual, including dialysis patients, has the right to work and contribute to society, and our goal is to make this a reality.

## Features

### Delightful visuals

We believe first impressions are important, reflecting the job application process and encouraging employers to explore the website.

- Friendly avatars and delightful animations make using the website a pleasant experience
- Responsive design allows the website to be used on mobile devices for on-the-go convenience

### Informative sections

Designed to help employers understand and empathise with kidney patients, the website offers a repository of useful information.

> *Keep track of applied jobs*

To transform information into action, we integrated a job portal into the website to connect kidney patients with potential employers easily.

- Employers can view all their job postings on one page, including the applicants who applied for them
- Kidney patients have a curated list of jobs from accommodating employers, and a quick way to view their application statuses

### Employer and Patient blogs

On a more personalised note, employers and kidney patients alike can share their previous experiences working with each other, showing newcoming employers the potential of hiring kidney patients and providing patients with a source of hope and wisdom.

### Profile customisation
